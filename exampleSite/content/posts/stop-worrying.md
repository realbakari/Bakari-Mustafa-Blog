To answer these questions, we must understand that the vast majority of our fears and anxieties amount to one thing: Loss.

We fear:
> Losing our youth.
> Losing our social status.
> Losing our money.
> Losing control.
> Losing our comfort.
> Losing our life.

We also fear, perhaps more than anything else, being rejected by others. This kind of fear is widespread and debilitating if left unaddressed. Why is this fear so deeply entrenched in us? In ancient tribal times, being rejected from the safety of the community could have meant death. So it’s no wonder, really, that we want to be accepted by others.

Fear is an instinctual human emotion designed to keep us aware and safe – like the headlights on a car clearly illuminating the twists and turns on the road ahead. But too much fear, like high beams blinding us on a dark, foggy road, can cause the loss of the very thing we feared losing in the first place.
