I write because I read. This is a list of book that covers a broad range of insight and ideas. some of these have a big impact on how I think, but there are some other valuable reads that I have left out. it's fun to look back at what you've accomplished this year.

For this year Book recommendation list, I choose five titles I think you'll enjoy reading. if you only have to read one or two books, I highly recommend you pick on the below list - They are listed in no particular order.

1. Man's Search For Meaning
Man's Search For Meaning. In Man's Search for Meaning, psychologist Victor Frankl draws on his experiences in Auschwitz to develop his method of logotherapy. In the concentration camp, he discovered that the desire to find meaning is essential to the human experience. He uses this knowledge in his psychoanalytic practice


2. Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion by Robert Cialdini, Ph.D.
The book talks about various psychological tactics used by compliance practitioners like salespeople, waiters, car dealers, and fundraisers to influence us into saying yes to something to which ideally we would have said no. Influence explains the psychology of why people say “yes”—and how to apply these understandings, Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion will help you gain a better understanding of the human mind and human behavior.

On the surface, this might seem like a great idea, but in his dystopian novel Brave New World Aldous Huxley shows how dangerous it can be to let the government regulate happiness.

Divided into two parts, the book first explains the neuroscience behind the brain’s capacity to keep and tell time. The second part goes into physical theo
