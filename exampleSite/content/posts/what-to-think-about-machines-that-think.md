Today's Leading Thinkers on the Age of Machine Intelligence.

 This book explores the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence, commonly known as AI. It is a compilation of several hundred short essays by some of the planet’s top experts on the subject and quite a few non-affiliated rather smart people who have taken the time to think about the subject.

In such a short review, it is only possible to barely scrape at the surface of the topic – the economic and market forces behind the drive towards AI would merit an essay of its own, but for anyone who follows the inexorable trajectory of Moore’s uncannily accurate Law, this is a book well worth reading, though it may lead to more questions than answers.

(Moore’s Law arose from Intel co-founder Gordon Moore’s 1965 prediction that processing power for computers will double every two years.)
